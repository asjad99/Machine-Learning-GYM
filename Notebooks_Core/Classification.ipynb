The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate. We want a classifier that correctly identifies as many positive instances as are available, with a very low percentage of negative instances incorrectly classified as positive. As a result, the ROC curve of a perfect classifier will go straight up the y axis (true positive rate) and then along the x axis (false positive rate). A classifier with no power will sit on the x=y diagonal. RMSE computes how far the predicted value is from the actual value.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-570d4bbe-1562-4703-b893-268ac27671bf","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"e120baed-f63a-4935-b0ad-4d9fa5f31443","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
