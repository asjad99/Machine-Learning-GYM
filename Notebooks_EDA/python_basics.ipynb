Python lists are not really \"lists\" in the typical CS sense of the word. A Python list, on the other hand, has a pointer to a contiguous buffer of pointers, each of which points to a Python object which in turn has references to its data (in this case, integers). \n \n \n![alt text](list_internal.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n \n \n \n \n Instead, a Python list is really a _dynamically sized array_.  That is, a list is an array of fixed-size elements (more precisely, it is an array of abstract \"Python Object\" elements, which in turn point to numbers, strings, other arrays, etc, while having the actual array elements in the list be fixed size).  The arrays are pre-allocated to have a certain amount of \"extra elements\" that can be used to add new items to the list; if we want to append a new item to the list, and do not have enough room in the underlying array, it is resized with some additional buffer (for example, the underlying size could be doubled ... though in reality Python uses a slightly more involved growth algorithm than just doubling each time) to allow for the additional elements.  Because this resizing happens relatively infrequently, it does not cost much from a computational perspective.  Put in big O notation, the following operations are lists are all constant time:\n\n- Append: O(1) (average case)\n- Lookup: O(1)\n- Delete last element: O(1)\n\nOn the other hand, if you attempt to insert a new element somewhere in the middle of the list (shifting down later element), or delete an item in the middle of the list (shifting up later elements), these operations are expensive, because we need to copy every single item in the list after the inserted or deleted item, and move it in memory.  In big O notation, the following operations take linear time:\n\n- Insert element at arbitrary position: O(n)\n- Delete element at arbitrary position: O(n)\n\nAs an illustration of this, let's consider two versions of code that creates an array, either by appending or inserting (at the beginning of the list) new elements:","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00029-efa75b8b-8970-428e-9506-da5f72385344","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00026-7b70bc6a-03c0-417d-bb3a-4541d136cc46","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Dictionaries\n\nThe next main built in data type you'll use in data science is the dictionary.

That is, the dictionary elements are all contained in a relatively small array.  When inserting a new element in the dictionary, we compute a _hash_ of the key, and modulo this number by the size of the array.  If that location in the underlying array is empty, we store the key/value pair at that index.  The the location is already with note _different_ element (which has to be possible, since there are more possible keys than the size of the underlying array) we execute what is called a \"probing strategy\" to find the next free slot.  The details of the hashing function and probing strategy aren't important (some info is on the page linked below), but the key portions are that the process is deterministic, so we can easily both assign elements and look up elements by key (similarly computing the hash and probing until the key at the location matches the key we are looking for ... note that this is why we need to store both the key _and_ value in the array).\n\nA good hash function will tend to generate \"random\" locations in the array, so there is a high probably we will find an empty slot without too many probing iterations.  In Python, once the array is 2/3 full, we double (or quadruple, for small-sized dictionaries) the size of the underlying array, and rebuild the hash table (which is required, since the location of different key/values pairs now changes for a different size of underlying array).  Just like with a list, although this rebuilding operation is slow, because it happens relatively infrequently, it does not end up costing too much time.
