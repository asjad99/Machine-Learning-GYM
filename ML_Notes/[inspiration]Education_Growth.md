THere are tons of courses online - but perhaps the greatest benifit can come from math. Because our society runs on it. 



*Every day the mathematical sciences are used to solve otherwise intractable problems. On a daily basis we rely on the cryptography that secures our transactions over the internet and the optimal allocation of scarce resources, such as the radio spectrum which allows our mobile phones to work in crowded areas. The mathematical sciences underpin numerous scientifc, technical and social advances that improve health and raise living standards. Genetic analysis relies on statistical methodologies, allowing improvements in human, animal and plant health. Machine learning, artifcial intelligence (AI) and data science are dependent on mathematics to fnd patterns in complex datasets. The risk of pension and investment funds is managed and minimised using mathematical models and actuarial science. Operational research and statistical analysis underpin the high productivity of numerous industries and are extensively used by government and throughout the economy. Our national defence relies on advanced engineering and technology underpinned by sophisticated mathematical modelling, whilst our national security has long depended on sophisticated mathematics and remains a major employer of very high-calibre mathematicians. Flood management, meteorology, and the assessment of natural hazard risks rely on mathematical and statistical modelling. Mathematics is increasingly leveraged by those economies intending to compete by enabling digital, biomedical and environmental innovation to generate greater social and economic benefts.*



We live in the era of mathematics. Its infuence permeates economic and social activity and its infuence and impact are profound. Yet its role is not well understood, we are not using it as well as we could and should, and we are investing too little. This report shows how we can do much better by reforming our institutions and investing more strongly, with potentially great benefts and relatively modest cost for the economy as a whole. There can be fewer more productive, creative and exciting investments than investing in mathematics.

This is the era of mathematics and its infuence will become still more intense.

* Management Science 

 *Like operational research itself, management science (MS) is an interdisciplinary branch of applied mathematics devoted to optimal decision planning, with strong links with economics, business, engineering, and other [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science)*

*It uses various [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research)-based principles, [strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy), and [analytical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_method) including [mathematical modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model), statistics and [numerical algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_algorithm) to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems. Management scientists help businesses to achieve their goals using the scientific methods of operational research.*

*The management scientist's mandate is to use rational, systematic, science-based techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds.*

*Management science is concerned with developing and applying [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modeling) and [concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept) that may prove useful in helping to illuminate management issues and solve managerial problems, as well as designing and developing new and better models of organizational excellence.[[32\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research#cite_note-LS-32)
