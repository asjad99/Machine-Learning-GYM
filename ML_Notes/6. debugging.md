#### What are some of the challenges in Machine learning that hinder us from getting great results? 



The system will not perform well if your training set is too small, or if the data is not representative, is noisy, or is polluted with Irrelvant features.

Lastly, your model needs to be neither too simple nor too complex(in which case it will overfit).



You want to find the right balance between fitting the training data perfectly and keeping the model simple enough to ensure that it will generaelize wll 



1. **Insufficent quantity of training data** 

​    Having a decent amount of data can beat superior algorithms (unreasonable effectiveness of data)



2. **Training set should be a representative of the cases we will encounter in the future** 

​    this allows us to generalize well 

3. **Poor Quality data** 

​    if the data has missing values, erronous entries, or outliers then its not going perform well 



**4. Using Irrelvant features will lead** 

​    Feature Engineering involves: Feature selectiion, Feature extraction (combing feature to get a more useful. e.g with using dimensionality reduction), gathering new data



5. **Overfitting means it performs well on the training data but doesnt generalize well.** 



 Regulization: Constraining a model to make it simpler can reduce the risk of overfitting. 



 e.g in linear regression we can reduce the dgree of freedom from 2 to 1 by setting theta1 = 0 



 Thus, we can play with the model hyperparemeters (which give a degreee of freedom) to control the amount of regularization



 \6. Underfitting 



 Underfitting occurs when your model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data.
